# NEXT.md - What to Work On

## üìç Current Status

### Recently Completed
- ‚úÖ Server-side caching implementation with Fastify
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive space API research (see SPACE_APIS_REFERENCE.md)
- ‚úÖ Architecture decision for API integration (see docs/ADR-001)
- ‚úÖ Engineering backlog created (see docs/ENGINEERING_BACKLOG.md)
- ‚úÖ Personas review completed (see docs/PERSONAS_ROUND_TABLE.md)

### Project State
- Basic ISS tracking working with Open Notify API
- Server caching layer implemented and tested
- Ready to add enhanced features (velocity, altitude, predictions)

### Security Check ‚úÖ
- Scanned codebase for secrets - **none found**
- API keys properly handled as optional parameters only
- No hardcoded credentials detected

## üéØ Immediate Tasks

### 1. Documentation Cleanup
- **README.md** + **README_SERVER.md** have duplicate server setup info
- **CACHING.md** + **CACHING_IMPLEMENTATION.md** cover same caching topics
- **README_CACHE_FIX.md** is temporary fix doc that should be integrated
- Consolidate server docs into main README
- Merge caching docs into single comprehensive guide

### 2. Project Structure Cleanup
- Clean up log files in root (`frontend.log`, `server-dev.log`, etc.)
- Review `/docs` folder organization
- Verify all npm scripts work correctly

### 3. Phase 0: Infrastructure Setup
**Priority tasks from docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md:**
1. Set up OpenTelemetry for distributed tracing
2. Create API mock library for testing
3. Implement circuit breaker pattern
4. Add performance monitoring

## üöÄ Next Development Phases

### Phase 1 Preview (After Phase 0)
Implement enhanced ISS tracking:
- Integrate Where the ISS at? API
- Add velocity and altitude displays
- Implement API fallback chains
- Create real-time update system

### Phase 2-4 Roadmap
- Phase 2: User location features (pass predictions)
- Phase 3: Space weather integration (aurora alerts)
- Phase 4: Launch tracking (crew missions)

## üìã Key Decisions Made

1. **API Strategy**: Multi-layered with fallbacks (Where ISS ‚Üí Open Notify ‚Üí Cache)
2. **Architecture**: Server-side proxy for all external APIs
3. **Privacy**: Location data never leaves browser
4. **Caching**: Different TTLs per data type (1s-6h)

## üí° Development Context

We just finished planning a major enhancement to transform SpaceBoard from a simple ISS tracker to a comprehensive space dashboard. The plan is documented and ready for implementation. Phase 0 (infrastructure) should be completed before starting feature development.

The personas round table identified that we need monitoring, mocking, and performance infrastructure BEFORE adding new features. This is critical for success.
