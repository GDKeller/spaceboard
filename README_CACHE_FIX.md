# Fixing Incomplete Cached Data

The caching system now includes several improvements to ensure complete data:

## 1. Data Completeness Validation

Before caching, the system checks that astronaut data meets these criteria:
- Has basic info (name, craft)
- Has enriched data (image, bio, or flight count)
- Has country information (not "Unknown")

Only data that is **60% complete or better** gets cached.

## 2. Enhanced Fallback Data

Added comprehensive fallback data for all current ISS astronauts:
- **NASA**: Tracy Caldwell Dyson, Matthew Dominick, Michael Barratt, Jeanette Epps, Butch Wilmore, Sunita Williams
- **Roscosmos**: Oleg Kononenko, Nikolai Chub, Alexander Grebenkin
- **Automatic detection** for Chinese astronauts based on names

## 3. Force Refresh Button

Added a **REFRESH** button in the header that:
- Clears all cached data
- Forces fresh API calls
- Bypasses the 24-hour cache TTL

## How to Get Complete Data

1. **Clear existing incomplete cache**:
   ```javascript
   astronautCache.clear()
   ```

2. **Click the REFRESH button** in the UI header

3. **Check cache status**:
   ```javascript
   cacheStatus()
   ```

The system will now:
- Try the Launch Library API first
- Use comprehensive fallback data if API fails
- Only cache data that passes completeness checks
- Show data quality logs in console

## Monitoring Data Quality

Open the browser console to see:
- `[Data Quality] Astronaut data completeness: XX%`
- `[Cache] Using cached data (XX% complete)`
- Individual astronaut data merge logs

This ensures you always have complete, high-quality astronaut data!
