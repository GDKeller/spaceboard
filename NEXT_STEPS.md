# Next Steps for SpaceBoard Development

> Created: January 2025
> Context: Just completed comprehensive API research and planning phase

## 🎯 Immediate Next Action

**Start Phase 0: Infrastructure Setup** (see docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md)

Priority tasks:
1. Set up OpenTelemetry for distributed tracing
2. Create API mock library for testing
3. Implement circuit breaker pattern
4. Add performance monitoring

## 📍 Current State

### Recently Completed
- ✅ Server-side caching implementation with Fastify
- ✅ Comprehensive space API research (see SPACE_APIS_REFERENCE.md)
- ✅ Architecture decision for API integration (see docs/ADR-001)
- ✅ Engineering backlog created (see docs/ENGINEERING_BACKLOG.md)
- ✅ Personas review completed (see docs/PERSONAS_ROUND_TABLE.md)

### Project Status
- Basic ISS tracking working with Open Notify API
- Server caching layer implemented and tested
- Ready to add enhanced features (velocity, altitude, predictions)

## 🚀 Phase 1 Preview (After Phase 0)

Implement enhanced ISS tracking:
- Integrate Where the ISS at? API
- Add velocity and altitude displays
- Implement API fallback chains
- Create real-time update system

## 📋 Key Decisions Made

1. **API Strategy**: Multi-layered with fallbacks (Where ISS → Open Notify → Cache)
2. **Architecture**: Server-side proxy for all external APIs
3. **Privacy**: Location data never leaves browser
4. **Caching**: Different TTLs per data type (1s-6h)

- `/server/` - Caching server implementation

## 💡 Context for Next Session

We just finished planning a major enhancement to transform SpaceBoard from a simple ISS tracker to a comprehensive space dashboard. The plan is documented and ready for implementation. Phase 0 (infrastructure) should be completed before starting feature development.

The personas round table identified that we need monitoring, mocking, and performance infrastructure BEFORE adding new features. This is critical for success.
